            <p>But really life's turn-ups are twisters. You lay out
            for larks, 'ealth, and tin,</p>

            <p>But whenever you think it's "a moral," that crock,

            <p>And it left me a yaller-skinned skelinton, weak,
            and, wot's wus, stoney-broke.</p>

            <p>If it hadn't a bin for my nunky, your pal might have

            <p>To spread myself out with the toppers is proper, no
            doubt, bonny boy;</p>

            <p>But&mdash;I wish it wos Brighton, or Margit, or
            somewheres a chap could <i>enjoy</i>.</p>

            <p>Till you've tried "Sulphur 'ot and strong," fasting.
            The Kissing Gin, taken a-fizz,</p>

            <p>Isn't <i>wus</i> than ditch-water and sherbet; but
            Sulphur!!! It's eased my game leg;</p>

            <p>But I go with my heart in my mouth, and I feel like
            a blooming bad hegg.</p>

            <p>B-r-r-r-r! Beastliness isn't the word, CHARLIE.
            Language seems out of it, slap.</p>

            <p>When I took my fust twelve ounces 'ot, from a gal
            with a snowy white cap,</p>

            <p>And cheeks like a blush-rose for
            bloominess&mdash;well, I'm a gent, but, yah-hah!</p>

            <p>I jest did a guy at the double, without even nodding

            cocksure can't 'ave a <i>wus</i> smell.</p>

            <p>Like bad eggs, salt, and tenpenny nails biled in
            bilge water. Eugh! Old Pump Well?</p>

            <p>Wy then let well alone, is my motter, or leastways,
            it would be, I'm sure,</p>

            <p>But for BLACK&mdash;local doctor, a
            stunner!&mdash;who's got me in 'and for a cure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I'm not nuts on baths took <i>too</i> reglar; but
            'Arrygate baths ain't 'arf bad,</p>

            <p>When you git a bit used to 'em, CHARLIE. I squirmed,
            though fust off, dear old lad!</p>

            <p>They so soused, and so slapped, and so squirted me.
            Messing a feller about</p>

            <p>Don't come nicer for calling it <i>massage</i>. But
            there, it's O.K. I've no doubt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>They squat you upon a low shelf, with a sort of a
            water-can "rose"</p>

            <p>At the nape of yer neck, while a feller in front
            squirts yer down with a 'ose.</p>

            <p>He slaps you as though you wos batter, he kneads you
            as if you wos dough,</p>

            <p>And gives yer wot for on the spine, till you git in
            a doose of a glow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then you're popped in a big iron cage, where the
            'ose plays upon you like fun;</p>

            <p>A lawn, or a house a-fire, CHARLIE, could not be
            more thoroughly done.</p>

            <p>Sez I, "I'm <i>insured</i>, dontcher know, mate; so
            don't <i>waste</i> the water, d'ye 'ear?"</p>

            <p>But he didn't appear to arf twig. He seemed jest a
            bit thick in the clear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then the bars of yer cage bustes out like a lot of
            scent fountings a-play&mdash;</p>

            <p>'Taint <i>oder colong</i>, though, by hodds; sulphur
            strong seems the local <i>bokay</i>.</p>

            <p>They call this the "Needle Bath," CHARLIE. It give
            <i>me</i> the needle fust off;</p>

            <p>'Cos the spray would git into my eyes, and the
            squelch made me sputter and cough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then they wrop you well up in 'ot towels, and leave
            yer five minutes to bake,</p>

            <p>And that's the "<i>Aix Douche</i>," as they call it.
            <i>I</i> call it the funniest fake</p>

            <p>In the way of a bath I 'ave met with; but, bless
            yer, it passes the time,</p>

            <p>And <i>I</i> shan't want a tub for a fortnit when
            back in Old Babbylon's grime.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">

            <p>Is watching the poor sulphur-swiggers, a-gargling
            and going it blind.</p>

            <p>Oh, the sniffs and sour faces, old fellow, the
            shudders and shivers, and sighs;</p>

            <p>The white lips a-working like rabbits', the sheepish
            blue-funk in their eyes!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Old Pump Room's a hoctygon building, rum blend like

            hallygorical subject! So far</p>

            <p>As I've yet made it out, it's a hangel a-stirring up
            somethink like suds.</p>

            <p>"A-troubling the waters," I 'eard from a party in
            clerical duds.</p>

            <i>like it</i>! Bet long hodds <i>I</i> shan't.</p>

            <p>I've sampled the lot, my dear CHARLIE, Strong
            Sulphur and Mild, Cold <i>and</i> 'Ot;</p>

            <p>And all I can say is, the jossers who say it ain't

        <div class="stanza">

            keep their hupper lips stiff;</p>

            <p>Take their tickets, walk up to the counter, assumin'
            a sham sort of bounce,</p>

            <p>Sez the minx with a cold kind o' smile.
            "Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h! <i>per</i>cisely!" they smirks,
            and walks round,</p>

            <p>With this "Yorkshire Stinko" in their

            <p>But NELSON, you know, died a good while ago,</p>

            <p>And his flag-ship has gone a bit shaky, and so</p>

    <p>Not long ago I reminded you of CHEPSTOWE, the incomparable
    poet who was at one time supposed to have revolutionised the
    art of verse. Now he is forgotten, the rushlight which he never
    attempted to hide under the semblance of a bushel, has long
    since nickered its last, his boasts, his swelling literary
    port, his quarrels, his affectations&mdash;over all of them the
    dark waves of oblivion have passed and blotted them from the
    sand on which he had traced them. But in his day, as you
    remember, while yet he held his head high and strutted in his
    panoply, he was a man of no small consequence. Quite an army of
    satellites moved with him, and did his bidding. To one of them
    he would say, "Praise me this author," and straightway the fire
    of eulogy would begin. To another he would declare&mdash;and
    this was his more frequent course&mdash;"So-and-so has dared to
    hint a fault in one of us; he has hesitated an offensive
    dislike. Let him be scarified," and forthwith the painted and
    feathered young braves drew forth their axes and
    scalping-knives, and the work of slaughter went merrily
    forward. Youth, modesty, honest effort, genuine merit, a
    manifest desire to range apart from the loud storms of literary
    controversy, these were no protection to the selected victim.
    And of course the operations of the Chepstowe-ites, like the
    "plucking" imagined by <i>Major Pendennis</i>, were done in
    public. For they had their organ. Week by week in <i>The
    Metropolitan Messenger</i> they disburdened themselves, each
    one of his little load of spite and insolence and vanity, and
    with much loud shouting and blare of adulatory trumpets called
    the attention of the public to their heap of purchasable
    rubbish. There lived at this time a great writer, whose name
    and fame are still revered by all who love strong, nervous
    English, vivid description, and consummate literary art. He
    stood too high for attack. Only in one way could the herd of
    passionate prigs who waited on CHEPSTOWE do him an injury. They
    could attempt, and did, to imitate his style in their own
    weekly scribblings. <i>Corruptio optimi pessima</i>. There is
    no other phrase that describes so well the result of these
    imitative efforts. All the little tricks of the great man's
    humour were reproduced and defaced, the clear stream of his
    sentences was diverted into muddy channels, the airy creatures
    of his imagination were weighted with lead and made to perform
    hideous antics. Never had there been so riotous a jargon of
    distorted affectation and ponderous balderdash.
    Smartness&mdash;of a sort&mdash;these gentlemen, no doubt,
    possessed. It is easy to be accounted smart in a certain
    circle, if only you succeed in being insolent. Merit of this
    order the band could boast of plenteously.</p>

    <p>One peculiarity, too, must be noted in <i>The Metropolitan
    Messenger</i>. It had a magnetic attraction for all the sour
    and sorry failures whose reputation and income, however greatly
    in excess of their deserts, had not equalled their expectation.
    The Cave of Adullam could not have been more abundantly stocked
    with discontent. It is the custom of the <i>ratés</i>
    everywhere to attempt to prevent, or, if that be impossible, to
    decry success in others, in order to exalt themselves. The
    "Metropolitans" followed the example of many unillustrious
    predecessors, though it must, in justice, be added, that they
    would have been shocked to hear anyone impute to them a want of
    originality in their curious methods. In the counsels of these
    literary bravos, WILLIAM GRUBLET held a high place. At the
    University, where he had pursued a dull and dingy career of
    modified respectability, not much was thought or spoken of
    GRUBLET. If he was asked what profession he proposed to adopt,
    he would wink knowingly, and reply, "Journalism." It sounded
    well&mdash;it gave an impression of influence, and future
    power, and, moreover, it committed him to nothing. It is just
    as easy to say "Journalism," in answer to the stock question,
    as it is to deliver yourself over, by anticipation, to the Bar,
    the Church, or the Stock Exchange. Hundreds of young men at
    both our ancient Universities look upon Journalism as the
    easiest and most attractive of all the professions. In the
    first place there are no Examinations to bar the way, and your
    ordinary Undergraduate loathes an Examination as a rat may be
    supposed to loathe a terrier. What can be easier&mdash;in
    imagination&mdash;than to dash off a leading article, a biting
    society sketch, a scathing review, to overturn ancient idols,
    to inaugurate movements, to plan out policies? All this GRUBLET
    was confident of being able to do, and he determined, on the
    strength of a few successful College Essays, and a reputation
    for smartness, acquired at the expense of his dwindling circle
    of intimates, to do it. He took his degree, and plunged into
    London. There, for a time, he was lost to public sight. But I
    know that he went through the usual contest. Rejected
    manuscripts poured back into his room. Polite, but
    unaccommodating Editors, found that they had no use for vapid
    imitations of ADDISON, or feeble parodies of CHARLES LAMB.
    Literary appreciations, that were to have sent the ball of fame
    spinning up the hill of criticism, grew frowsy and dog's-eared
    with many postages to and fro.</p>

    <p>In this protracted struggle with fate and his own
    incompetence, the nature of GRUBLET, never a very amiable one,
    became fatally soured, and when he finally managed to secure a
    humble post on a newspaper, he was a disappointed man with rage
    in his heart against his successful rivals and against the
    Editors who, as he thought, had maliciously chilled his glowing
    aspirations. His vanity, however,&mdash;and he was always a
    very vain man&mdash;had suffered no diminution, and with the
    first balmy breezes of success his arrogance grew unbounded.
    Shortly afterwards, he chanced to come in the way of CHEPSTOWE;
    he impressed the poet favourably, and in the result he was
    selected for a place on the staff of <i>The Metropolitan
    Messenger</i>, then striving by every known method to battle
    its way into a circulation.</p>

    <p>It was at this stage in his career that I met GRUBLET. He
    was pointed out to me as a young man of promise who had a
    trenchant style, and had lately written an article on
    "Provincialism in Literature," which had caused some stir by
    its bitter and uncompromising attacks upon certain well-known
    authors and journalists. I looked at the man with some
    interest. I saw a pale-faced, sandy-haired little creature with
    a shuffling, weak-kneed gait, who looked as if a touch from a
    moderately vigorous arm would have swept him altogether out of
    existence. His manner was affected and unpleasant, his
    conversation the most disagreeable I ever listened to. He was
    coarse, not with an ordinary coarseness, but with a kind of
    stale, fly-blown coarseness as of the viands in the window of a
    cheap restaurant. He assumed a great reverence for RABELAIS and
    ARISTOPHANES; he told shady stories, void of point and humour,
    which you were to suppose were modelled on the style of these
    two masters. And all the time he gave you to understand, with a
    blatant self-sufficiency, that he himself was one of the
    greatest and most formidable beings in existence. This was
    GRUBLET as I first knew him, and so he continued to the
    end.</p>

    <p>The one thing this puny creature could never forgive was
    that any of his friends should pass him in the race. There was
    one whom GRUBLET&mdash;the older of the two&mdash;had at one
    time honoured with his patronage and approval. No sooner,
    however, had the younger gained a literary success, than the
    sour GRUBLET turned upon him, and rent him. "This fellow," said
    GRUBLET, "will get too uppish&mdash;I must show up his trash";
    and accordingly he fulminated against his friend in the organ
    that he had by that time come to consider as his own. This
    baseless sense of proprietorship, in fact, it was that wrecked
    GRUBLET. In an evil moment for himself he tried to ride
    rough-shod over CHEPSTOWE, and that temporary genius dismissed
    him with a promptitude that should stand to his credit against
    many shortcomings. GRUBLET, I believe, still exists.
    Occasionally, in obscure prints, I seem to detect traces of his
    style. But no one now pays any attention to him. His claws are
    clipped, his teeth have been filed down. He shouts and struts,
    unregarded. For we live, of course, in milder and more
    reasonable days, and the GRUBLETS can no longer find a popular
    market for their wares.</p>

    <p>Only one question remains. How in the world can even you, oh
    respected SWAGGER, have derived any pleasure from witnessing
    the performances that GRUBLET went through, after you had
    persuaded him that he was a man of some importance? I do not
    expect an answer, and remain as before,</p>

    <p>When anyone now in town requires a change from the
    <i>De</i>-lights of Home, let him go to <i>See Lights of
    Home</i> at the Adelphi. Great scene of the Wreck not so great
    perhaps as some previous sensational Adelphi effects. In such a
    piece as "the Lights," it is scarcely fair that "the Heavies"
    should have it nearly all to themselves, but so it is, and the
    two Light Comedy parts capitally played by Miss JECKS and Mr.
    LIONEL RIGNOLD, do not get much of a chance against the
    heartrending sorrows of Miss EVELYN MILLARD, and of Mrs.
    PATRICK CAMPBELL, the slighted, or sea-lighted heroine, known
    as "Dave's Daughter" (oh, how fond Mr. W.A. ELLIOTT must be of
    <i>Dave Purvis</i>, the weakest
    sentimentalist-accidental-lunatic-criminal that ever was let
    off scot-free at R.H. first entrance before the fall of the

    <p>SUMMARY OF RESULT FOR OLD CATHOLIC
    CONGRESS.&mdash;<i>Lucernâ Lucellum</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I got so wet on the St. Leger day,
    that I've been in bed ever since&mdash;not because I had to
    wait till my things were dry&mdash;but because I caught a cold!
    <i>What</i> a day it was!&mdash;I am told that in addition to
    the St. Leger, Doncaster is chiefly celebrated for <i>Butter
    Scotch</i>&mdash;if so, I presume they don't make it
    out-of-doors, or it would have stood a good chance of being
    melted&mdash;(not in the mouth)&mdash;on Wednesday fortnight!
    But the excitement of the race fully made up for the liquid
    weather, and we all&mdash;(except the backers of
    <i>Orme</i>)&mdash;enjoyed ourselves. I was told that the Duke
    of WESTMINSTER had "left the Leger at Goodwood," which is
    simply absurd, as I not only saw it run for at Doncaster
    myself, but it is ridiculous to insinuate that the Duke went
    there, put the Leger in his pocket&mdash;(as if a Nobleman ever
    kept books)&mdash;walked off quietly to Goodwood and left it
    there deliberately!</p>

    <p>I conclude it can only be an expression coined to
    discount&mdash;(another ledger term)&mdash;the victory of <i>La
    Flèche</i>,&mdash;to which not half enough attention has been
    drawn, solely (in my opinion) because <i>La Flèche</i> is of
    the gentler sex, and men don't like the "horse of the year" to
    be a mare.</p>

    <p>I still maintain she was unlucky to lose the Derby, as she
    won the Oaks two days later in two seconds quicker
    time:&mdash;(which is an anachronism&mdash;as if you win
    <i>once</i> out of <i>twice</i>&mdash;how can it be two
    <i>seconds</i>?)</p>

    <p>There was good sport at Yarmouth last week, though owing to
    the rain the course must have been on the soft (roe)
    side,&mdash;by the way you can get them now in bottles, and
    very good they are. I am glad to see that staunch supporter of
    the turf, Lord ELTHAM, winning races again&mdash;as his horses
    have been much out of form lately, at least so I am told, but I
    was not aware that horses were in a "form" at all, unless being
    "schooled" over hurdles.</p>

    <p>I shall have a word or two to say on the Cesarewitch
    shortly&mdash;having had some private information calculated to
    break a ROTHSCHILD if followed&mdash;but for the moment will
    content myself with scanning the programme of the Leicester and
    Manchester Meetings.</p>

    <p>There are two races which seem perhaps worth picking
    up&mdash;one at each place; and, while giving my selection for
    the Leicestershire race in the usual verse, I will just mention
    that I should have given Lord DUNRAVEN's <i>Inverness</i> for
    the Manchester race, but that I see his Lordship has sent it to
    America&mdash;rather foolish, now that winter is coming on; but
    perhaps he has another, and may be doing a kindness to some
    poor American Cousin! <i>St. Angelo</i> might win this race
    without an Inverness, though I presume he will appear in
    <i>some</i> sort of clothing.</p>

    <h2>VERY ENTERTAINING.</h2>

    <p>Dear MR. PUNCH,&mdash;So much is done by the organisers of
    the Primrose League in the shape of amusements for the people,
    that it seems strange "the other side" should not follow suit.
    Without having decided political opinions, I like both the
    Government and Her Majesty's Opposition to be on equal terms.
    Hence my suggestion. I see that, a few days ago, Mr. GLADSTONE,
    in speaking to an audience at Barmouth, made the following
    remarks. He said&mdash;He belonged to almost every part of the
    country. A Scotchman by blood, born in Lancashire, and resident
    in London, he had become closely attached to Wales by marriage,
    and had now become too old to get rid of that inclination.
    Surely these admissions conjure up the possibility of a really
    excellent entertainment. To show you what I mean, I jot down,
    in dramatic form, my notion of the manner in which the
    PREMIER's excellent idea should be worked out:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A large hall, with a platform. On the
        platform, Committee and Chairman. In front of the Chairman,
        large table, with cloth reaching to the floor.
        Water-bottle, and tumbler, and lamp.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Chairman.</i> Ladies and Gentlemen, I have great
        pleasure in announcing that the Right Hon. W.E. GLADSTONE
        (<i>cheers</i>), will give his entertainment entitled "The
        Man of Many Characters" almost immediately. The PREMIER's
        train is a little late, but&mdash;ah, here come his
        fore-runners. (<i>Enter two Servants in livery with a large
        basket-box, which they place under the table and then
        retire.</i>) And now we may expect the PREMIER
        immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Enter</i> Mr. GLADSTONE <i>in evening dress
        hurriedly. He is received with thunders of
        applause.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mr. Gladstone.</i> Ladies and Gentlemen! (<i>Great
        cheering.</i>) I regret I have kept you waiting for some
        quarter of an hour. My excuse must be that I caused the
        train to be pulled up, because I noticed at a wayside
        station a crowd of villagers who, apparently, were desirous
        to hear me speak. You must forgive me, for it was for the
        good of the nation. (<i>Cheers.</i>) And now without
        preface, I will appear as my friend Farmer HODGE. (<i>Loud
        applause, during which the</i> PREMIER <i>dives under the
        table and re-appears in character. Continued applause.</i>)
        I be mighty glad to see ye. And now, I'll tell ye what I
        thinks about the Eight Hours' Bill. (<i>Airs his opinions
        in "Zomerzetshire" for some twenty minutes. At the
        conclusion of his performance re-appears in evening
        dress-coat. Applause.</i>) Thank you very much. But
        although Farmer HODGE is a very good fellow, I think SANDIE
        MACBAWBEE is even better. With your permission, I will
        appear as SANDIE MACBAWBEE. (<i>Disappears under table, and
        re-appears in Highland Costume. Cheers.</i>) Dinna fash
        yourselves! Ma gracious! It's ma opinion that you'll just
        hear a wee bit about Home Rule for Bonnie Scotland. Well,
        ye ken&mdash;(<i>Airs his opinions upon his chosen subject
        in broad Scotch. After a quarter of an hour he re-appears,
        and receives the usual applause.</i>) Thank you from the
        bottom of my heart. And now as I have shown you Scotland
        and England, I think you would be pleased with a glimpse of
        London. (<i>Cheers.</i>) You all like London, do you not?
        (<i>Applause.</i>) With your kind permission, I will
        re-appear as a noted character in the great tragic comedy
        of the world's Metropolis. (<i>Dives down and comes up as a
        Costermonger. Prolonged applause.</i>) What cheer!
        (<i>Laughter.</i>) Well, you blokes what are you grinning
        at? I am a chickaleary cove, that's what I am. But I know
        what would knock you! You would like to 'ear about 'Ome
        Rule. Eh? What cheer! 'Ere goes. (<i>Reveals his Home-Rule
        scheme with a Cockney twang and dialect. Then disappears
        and re-appears in his customary evening dress.</i>) Thank
        you most earnestly. (<i>Loud cheers.</i>) And now I am
        afraid I must bid you good-bye. But before leaving, I must
        confess to you that I have never had the honour of
        appearing before a juster, more intelligent, and more
        appreciative audience. [<i>Bows and exit.</i></p>

        <p><i>Voices.</i> Encore! Encore! Encore!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Gladstone</i> (<i>returning</i>). I am deeply
        touched by this sign of public confidence. I would
        willingly continue my character illustrations indefinitely,
        but, unfortunately, I am required in another part of the
        country to repeat the same performances. I have only just
        time to catch my special train. Thank you again and

    is not well enough to hear the news."</p>

    <p>Then ARMAND met Lady VIOLET.</p>

    <p>"I dreamed years ago of going to the City of Manoa to find
    its queen. I have found her this evening."</p>

    <p>"And she is&mdash;?" queried Lady VIOLET.</p>

    <p>"You!" hissed the Brazilian (he was a Brazilian), and
    departed.</p>

    <p>"What folly!" murmured Lady VIOLET, in the moonlight.</p>

    <p>And many agreed with her.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<i>The Garden of Dorothy Blair.</i></h3>

    <p>DOROTHY was on the Thames. There came to her ARMAND.</p>

    <p>"Will you never publish our contemplated marriage?" she
    asked.</p>

    <p>"How can I, child?" he replied. "How can I reveal the secret
    when your mother is not well enough to hear the news?"</p>

    <p>It was his solitary anecdote.</p>

    <p>She sighed, and then came a steam-launch. It contained Lady
    VIOLET, the other characters, lunch, and (played off) the
    "<i>Intermezzo</i>."</p>

    <p>Then ARMAND preferred to flirt with Lady VIOLET to
    DOROTHY.</p>

    <p>"What nonsense!" thought DOROTHY.</p>

    <p>And her thoughts found an echo in the breasts of the
    audience.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<i>Smoke in the Smoking-room.</i></h3>

    <p>And the Right Hon. RICHARD MALVERN, having had supper, was
    jealous of his wife. He told Lady VIOLET that he considered
    ARMAND <i>de trop</i>. But he did it so amiably that it touched
    Lady VIOLET deeply.</p>

    <p>"I will send ARMAND away," she replied. Then she told the
    Brazilian that it was his duty to stay away until his
    engagement was announced.</p>

    <p>"But how can it be announced?" he replied, repeating his
    solitary anecdote. "I am engaged to a young lady, but I cannot
    reveal the secret, because her mother is not well enough to
    hear the news."</p>

    <p>Then Lady VIOLET bade him, haughtily, adieu! He departed,
    but returned, accompanied by the "<i>Intermezzo</i>."
    Then&mdash;probably at the suggestion of the music&mdash;she
    hugged him. Then he left her.</p>

    <p>"This is very wearisome," murmured Lady VIOLET.</p>

    <p>And the audience agreed with her.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>A Weir on the Thames.</i></h3>

    <p>It being moonlight, Lady VIOLET walked on a terrace, and
    admired a dangerous weir. There was a shriek, and the Brazilian
    rushed in accompanied by the "<i>Intermezzo</i>."</p>

    <p>"Fly with me to any part of the Desert that pleases you
    most."</p>

    <p>"I would be most delighted," replied Lady VIOLET; "I would
    sacrifice myself to any extent, but I would not annoy my
    husband."</p>

    <p>"Then let me kiss you with the aid of MASCAGNI," and he
    pressed his lips to her brow, to the accompaniment of the
    "<i>Intermezzo</i>."</p>

    <p>"I have been to Manoa, and kissed its Queen," said the
    Brazilian, as he jumped into the weir, wearily. "It would have
    been better had I died before."</p>

    <p>"Yes," thought Lady VIOLET, as she leisurely fainted, "it
    would indeed have been better had he died in the First Act than
    in the last. Then the piece would have been shorter, more
    satisfactory, and less expensive to produce. Nay, more&mdash;a
    solitary Act might have been one too many!" And yet again the
    audience, "all o'er-bored," entirely agreed with her!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
